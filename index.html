                <h1>Hey Friends!</h1>
                <p>I'm an aspiring developer focused on Frontend and AI, learning in public as <strong>CodeMate</strong>—the calm space where I keep showing up, even when I feel a bit lost. I'm building small, honest projects in modern web tech and Python to strengthen my foundations, one step at a time. Writing things down, refactoring often, and shipping what I can helps me stay grounded. This path feels like where <strong>I've always meant to be</strong>.</p>

        <h2>How can we learn</h2>
        <details>
            <summary>How can we learn faster by building tiny projects each week?</summary>
            <p>Learning accelerates dramatically when we shift from theory to tangible practice, and building small projects every week is the perfect vehicle to achieve this. This approach converts passive knowledge into an active skill, as each project, by having a limited scope and a strict seven-day deadline, forces you to immediately apply concepts and solve real problems. By focusing on completing the essential functionality rather than pursuing perfection, you reap the motivation of a quick "win" and a finished product that demonstrates your new skill. This continuous rhythm of building and reflecting reduces analysis paralysis, maintains your momentum, and most importantly, teaches you to research and debug exactly at the moment of need—a learning method far more efficient and memorable than any passive tutorial.</p>

            <summary>How can we learn AI concepts by explaining them in simple words to each other?</summary>
            <p>Using the Feynman Technique to learn AI is highly effective because it immediately exposes gaps in understanding, forcing you to move beyond passive memorization. By explaining complex concepts like Backpropagation or Transformers in simple, non-technical language and using everyday analogies, you strengthen your grasp of the core logic. When your learning partner asks relentlessly clarifying questions, they challenge your assumptions, pushing you to distill the concept down to its foundational elements. This active cycle of explaining, challenging, and refining ensures that you don't just know what an AI concept is, but you profoundly understand how and why it works.</p>

            <summary>How can we learn consistently by turning curiosity into a daily 10-minute habit?</summary>
            <p>The key to consistent lifelong learning is transforming curiosity from a sporadic thought into a daily, non-negotiable 10-minute habit. This short duration minimizes the mental resistance to starting, ensuring high consistency where a longer commitment would fail. By using habit stacking—anchoring the learning to an existing routine like morning coffee—you remove the need for willpower. The session itself is a focused, two-part micro-burst: the first half is dedicated to finding a simple answer to a captured question, and the second half is used for active recall, such as writing a one-sentence summary or drawing a diagram. This consistent rhythm of input and immediate output leverages the compounding effect, ensuring that those 60 hours of annual effort lead to genuine mastery, not just passive information consumption.</p>
